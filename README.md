# Windows Azure Toolkit for Social Games #
The Windows Azure Toolkit for Social Games is a set of guidance, samples, and tools that helps developers quickly get started building a casual or social game on Windows Azure. There are two main components of this project. First, there is the toolkit. This download contains the core services and samples needed to learn the basics of social game development. The toolkit contains several simple games and the required server APIs. The second portion of this project is the game Tankster. Tankster is a multi-player social game that is built on top of the core toolkit. The full source Tankster sample is available for download including images, audio, JavaScript, and more.
